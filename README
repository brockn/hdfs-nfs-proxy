 == How to use ==

1) mkdir /mnt/hdfs

2) Add this entry to /etc/fstab
localhost:/   /mnt/hdfs   nfs4       rw,intr,timeo=600,proto=tcp,port=2050      0 0

3) Ensure you have maven installed and hadoop command configured
with *-site.xml pointing at the namenode

4) mvn package && ./start-nfs-server.sh

Which will build, test, and then startup the HDFS NFS Proxy.

5) Mount hdfs

sudo mount /mnt/hdfs

6) You should now be able to access HDFS.

The script ./start-nfs-client-tests.sh runs basic tests.

 == What is not implemented ==

* Kerberos
* Appends
* Attributes dropped when mounting from Mac:
    Reccomended:
    14 archive
    25 hidden
    49 timebackup
    55 mounted on fileid

 == What needs improvement ==

* User Mapping
NFS4 User identities are user@domain. However, the RPC protocol uses UID/GID.
Currently we map the UID on the incoming request via the system we are currently on.
I think there is something in Hadoop which does user mapping as well. If so, it might
make sense to be consistent.
* Client ID - RFC 3530 (NFS4) has fairly complex logic which I do not follow.
* Read Ordering
At present we get a fair number of threads blocked on reads of a single input stream.
I think we could get better performance if we ordered these like writes because we
know they will arrive out of order. As such the current impl is doing more seeks
than required. We also might considering pooling input streams.
* Heavy read loads require a TON of gc
* Write Ordering
We buffer writes until we find the prereq, this memory consumption is not bounded.
* DirectoryEntry.getWireSize needs to be fixed, it is gross.
* Use Hadoop metrics insteead of simple MetricsPrinter
* Persist file handles and client ids to disk (zookeeper?)


 == FAQ ==
*All user/groups show up as `nobody'?

NFS4 returns user/group with user@domain. Today by default it responds with
user@clientDomain. The client then uses the idmap service to lookup the user
for a uid. As such, it's likely you have not configured idmap.

Say the domain is acme.com, you would change: /etc/idmapd.conf from:
 Domain = localdomain

to:

 Domain = bashkew.com

and then restart idmapd:
 
/etc/init.d/rpcidmapd restart
